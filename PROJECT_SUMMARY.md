# $CHAOS - Meme Token Website

## 🎭 Overview

An absolutely unhinged, professionally-chaotic satirical meme token website featuring a political meme war between Trump vs Mamdani. This is performance art meets crypto degeneracy - a self-aware parody of both politics and cryptocurrency culture.

This website deliberately mocks:
- Crypto project promises and hype

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**"Intentionally stupid, professionally built"**

The website must:
- ✅ Look like a fever dream
- ✅ Be completely usable
- ✅ Have smooth animations
- ✅ Be self-aware
- ✅ NOT look like a normal crypto site
- ✅ Balance chaos with clarity

3. **Floating emojis** → Background chaos
4. **Changing poll numbers** → Never the same twice
5. **Footer hidden message** → For those who scroll to the bottom

## 🎭 Conclusion

This is not a crypto website. This is a living meme. A commentary. A joke that took itself seriously enough to be professionally built. It's chaos with a purpose: to make people laugh while being brutally honest about what it is (and isn't).

If you made it this far in the documentation: gg. You're truly one of us. 🫡
