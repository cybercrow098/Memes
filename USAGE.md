## Common Questions

**Q: Is this a real token?**
A: No. This is satire. Art. Comedy. Not a real investment.

**Q: Can I actually buy this?**
A: There's nothing to buy. The contract address is fake (0xDEADBEEF...CAFEBABE).

**Q: Who are these characters?**
A: Fictional, exaggerated satire. Any resemblance to real persons is intentional parody.

**Q: Does choosing a side do anything?**
A: It highlights your team throughout the site. That's it. Purely cosmetic.

**Q: Are the stats real?**
A: No. The poll fluctuates randomly. The community stats are made up. Everything is fake.

**Q: Is this legal?**
A: Yes. It's satire, protected speech. Multiple disclaimers throughout.

**Q: Should I invest in crypto based on this?**
A: Absolutely not. This is the opposite of financial advice. Consult professionals.

**Q: Can I contribute?**
A: This is a demo/art project. Not accepting contributions.

**Q: Will you add real sounds?**
A: Maybe! The UI is ready. Sound effects could be fun.

**Q: What's the point?**
A: To make you laugh. To satirize crypto culture. To demonstrate what a living meme website looks like.
