## 💡 Copy Philosophy

Every piece of text is:
- **Self-aware**: We know this is ridiculous
- **Satirical**: Mocking crypto culture and politics
- **Honest about dishonesty**: "We promise to be fake"
- **Legally safe**: Multiple disclaimers about satire
- **Funny**: Dark humor, internet culture, absurdist comedy

## ⚠️ Disclaimers

- This is 100% satire
- Not financial advice
- Not real investment opportunity
- Characters are fictional/exaggerated
- Contract address is fake
- All stats are random
- This is art/comedy, not a real token

## 🎨 Design Principles

1. **Chaos with Purpose**: Every glitch, animation, and effect serves the narrative
2. **Professional Stupidity**: High-quality code delivering intentional absurdity
3. **Meme-First**: If it wouldn't make sense on Twitter, it's perfect
4. **Self-Aware**: Breaking the fourth wall constantly
5. **No Cringe**: Satire that knows it's satire

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Maybe)

- Sound effects (airhorns, boos, crowd noises)
- More Easter eggs
- Animated character portraits
- "Chart" that moves randomly
- Community meme submissions
- More interactive polls
- NFT mockups (also satirical)
